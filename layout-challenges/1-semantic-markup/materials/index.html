		</header>

		<article>
			<p>SMTP is a relatively simple, text-based protocol, in which a mail sender communicates with a mail receiver by issuing simple command strings and supplying necessary data over a reliable ordered data stream channel, typically Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) connection.</p>
			
			<p>When we send an e-mail message from our computer to another computer, it will go trough many different servers before it actually reaches our recipient's computer. The first stop for our e-mail message is an SMTP e-mail server. This server communicates directly with our computer using a protocol named SMTP. It is the de facto standard for e-mail transmission from clients to mail servers via the Internet. SMTP is an old protocol and was used already in the 1980s to transfer messages between computers.</p>

			<ul>
				<li>Its objective is to transfer mail reliably and efficiently</li>
				<li>SMTP is the IETF's Standard Number 10, or STD0010</li>
				<li>Standard e-mail formats are also closely related to the SMTP standard</li>
